# Name-Day-Python
A simple python script for displaying the day of the year, and the name day, based on user input of a date in dd mm yyy format

It asks the user for a day (past, rpesent or future) in the dd mm yyyy format, and calculates the day of the year.  Then based on whether it is a leap year, it displays the index of the list (the yearday is the index).
